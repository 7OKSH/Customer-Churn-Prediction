# Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview

The Customer Churn Prediction project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. Churn prediction is crucial for businesses to identify customers who are likely to leave the service and take proactive measures to retain them. This project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Provides insights into the data through visualizations and statistical analysis.
- **Model Training**: Uses logistic regression to train a model on the processed data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC score.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
